# RPi_smart_house
!


This is a smart house PoC that allows the users to manipulate a lightbulb and a set of multicolor LED lights with a Raspberry Pi, an Arduino and Nodejs. It's built following the tutorial of ![W3 Schools nodejs smarthouse](https://www.w3schools.com/nodejs/nodejs_raspberrypi.asp) and a ![project of github.](https://github.com/hypriot/rpi-node-neopixel-example.git)

The lightbulb and the LEDs can totally be controlled with a Raspberry Pi but I decided to hook the Arduino to show my team members how the LEDs could independently be controlled with an Arduino (without automation)
